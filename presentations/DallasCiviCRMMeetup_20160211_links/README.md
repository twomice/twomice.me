Links to resources we discussed at the Dallas CiviCRM meetup ([Feb. 11, 2016](http://www.meetup.com/DFW-CiviCRM/events/223153498/)).


## CiviCRM-Buildkit

A collection of 20+ tools for developing and testing CiviCRM, notably including `civibuild`, which allows you to build (with a single command) a CiviCRM site of any version on any supported CMS.

## CiviDev

Issue one command to create a Virtual Machine that comes pre-configured with all the tools you'll need for CiviCRM development. Upon the first VM startup, installs a Drupal 7 site with CiviCRM, and civicrm-buildkit (see above) so you can easily create any number of sites with CiviCRM on any supported CMS. Shout-out to [@cividesk](http://twitter.com/cividesk) for contributing this awesome tool!
